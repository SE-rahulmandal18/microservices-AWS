What is API ?
Application Programming Interface 

Set of rules and protocols that allow one software application
to interact and communicate with another.

so with the help of these rules and protocols two software applications or two software systems can communicate with each other
so you can think of it like a messenger that delivers your
request to the provider that you are asking a service from and then it delivers the response from the provider back to you in the form of the response.

===================================================================

Status Code- A status code is a numerical value returned by a server in response to a client's request, indicating the status of the request. Status codes are primarily used in HTTP responses to communicate whether a request was successful, encountered an error, or requires further action.

1xx (Informational) – Request Received, Processing Continues

100 Continue – The server has received the request headers and the client should proceed with sending the request body.

101 Switching Protocols – The server is switching protocols as requested by the client (e.g., HTTP to WebSocket).

===================

2xx (Success) – Request Successfully Processed

200 OK – The request was successful, and the server returned the expected response.

201 Created – The request was successful, and a new resource was created.

204 No Content – The request was successful, but there is no response body.

======================

301 Moved Permanently – The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL.

302 Found (Moved Temporarily) – The requested resource is temporarily located at a different URL.

304 Not Modified – The requested resource has not changed since the last request (used for caching).


===========================


4xx (Client Errors) – Request Issues from the Client Side

400 Bad Request – The request is malformed or contains invalid parameters.
401 Unauthorized – Authentication is required but missing or incorrect.
403 Forbidden – The client does not have permission to access the resource.
404 Not Found – The requested resource does not exist on the server.
408 Request Timeout – The server timed out waiting for the client’s request.

==========================

5xx (Server Errors) – Issues from the Server Side

500 Internal Server Error – A generic error message indicating the server encountered an issue.
502 Bad Gateway – The server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
503 Service Unavailable – The server is temporarily overloaded or down for maintenance.
504 Gateway Timeout – The server, acting as a gateway, did not receive a timely response from an upstream server.

===============================================================

API requests are:

1) GET (Retrieve Data)-
Used to fetch data from the server.
It does not modify any data used only to read data

2) POST (Create Data)
Used to send data to the server to create a new resource.

3) PUT (Update Data)
Used to update an existing resource.
It replaces the entire resource with the new data.

4) PATCH (Partial Update)
Used to update partially an existing resource.
Only the provided fields are updated.

5) DELETE (Remove Data)
Used to delete a resource from the server.
